# Kinetic Learning
This Repository is a set of tools used to learn dynamics from time series data. This tool was applied so as to learn kinetic models from Time Series Proteomics and Metabolomics Data.

## How to Use This Repository

There are two main files in this repository: 'Create Data Set.ipynb' and 'KineticLearning.ipynb'. The first creates simulated data sets, and the second builds and analyzes models generated from proteomic and metabolomic data.  

Install the correct dependencies for the project, open the notebook of interest. Set the parameters at the top of the file, and run!
