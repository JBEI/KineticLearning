# Notebooks

This directory contains jupyter notebooks which either, reproduce the work outlined in the paper or demonstrate use of the library.

## Library Demos
Various demonstrations of how to use the refactored library in practice.

* [LearnLimoneneDynamics.ipynb](LearnLimoneneDynamics.ipynb) - An example where the dynamics of the limonene pathway are learned and production is maximized by modulating protein levels.


## Paper Reproduction
These notebooks are generally less well maintained than the demo notebooks.  These were used and modified heavily during the development of the software.  To make the tool usable we heavily refactored the tool.  Much of this code is legacy and will be depricated for future use, but it will reproduce the results found in the paper. 

* [ManuscriptNotebook.ipynb](ManuscriptNotebook.ipynb) - Reproduces a bulk of the analysis from the paper.

* [Create Data Set.ipynb](Create\ Data\ Set.ipynb) - Creates simulated strain data based on a hand built model of the metabolic pathway that results in the production of Limonene from Acetyl-CoA. 

* [Biological_Intuition.ipynb](Biological_Intution.ipynb) - Generates Data to Reproduce Figure 9 From the Paper.

* [Biological Inutition Plots.ipynb](Biological\ Inutition\ Plots.ipynb) - Creates the Plots for Figure 9 of the Paper.
